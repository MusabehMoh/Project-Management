# Team Member Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive team member dashboard has been created for QC Team Members, Software Developers, and Designer Team Members. The dashboard provides task management, quick actions, and calendar integration.

## Components Created

### 1. TeamMemberDashboard.tsx
**Location**: `src/components/dashboard/TeamMemberDashboard.tsx`
**Features**:
- Main dashboard layout for team members
- Quick stats display
- Integration with TeamQuickActions and MyAssignedTasks components
- Calendar view for scheduling
- Additional performance metrics (tasks completed, average completion time, upcoming deadlines)

### 2. MyAssignedTasks.tsx
**Location**: `src/components/dashboard/team-member/MyAssignedTasks.tsx`
**Features**:
- Displays tasks assigned to the current user
- Shows top 5 tasks with "View All" option
- Task status and priority indicators with color coding
- Project name and due date information
- Click to view full task details
- Error handling and loading states

### 3. TeamQuickActions.tsx
**Location**: `src/components/dashboard/team-member/TeamQuickActions.tsx`
**Features**:
- Quick status updates for tasks
- Start/Pause/Complete actions based on current status
- Modal for updating task status
- Status selection dropdown with proper mapping
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

## Custom Hooks Created

### 1. useMyAssignedTasks.ts
**Location**: `src/hooks/useMyAssignedTasks.ts`
**Purpose**: Fetches tasks assigned to the current user with automatic filtering by API

### 2. useTeamQuickActions.ts
**Location**: `src/hooks/useTeamQuickActions.ts`
**Purpose**: Fetches actionable tasks (non-completed) and provides status update functionality

## Backend API Enhancements

### MembersTasksController.cs
**Location**: `pma-api-server/src/PMA.Api/Controllers/MembersTasksController.cs`

**New Endpoint Added**:
```csharp
[HttpPut("{id}/status")]
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateTaskStatus(int id, [FromBody] UpdateTaskStatusRequest request)
```

**Features**:
- Updates task status based on string values (Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Completed)
- Maps status strings to status IDs (1=Pending, 2=In Progress, 3=Blocked, 4=Completed)
- Automatically sets progress to 100% when completed
- Returns updated task information

**Request Model**:
```csharp
public class UpdateTaskStatusRequest
{
    public string Status { get; set; }
}
```

## Service Layer Updates

### membersTasksService.ts
**Location**: `src/services/api/membersTasksService.ts`

**New Method Added**:
```typescript
async updateTaskStatus(taskId: number, newStatus: string): Promise<ApiResponse<void>>
```

## Translations Added

### English Translations
- Team dashboard title and subtitle
- My assigned tasks section (title, viewing info, empty states)
- Quick actions section (title, subtitle, action buttons)
- Status labels (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
- Success and error messages

### Arabic Translations
- Complete Arabic translations for all team dashboard features
- RTL support maintained

## Role-Based Routing

### Updated index.tsx
**Location**: `src/pages/index.tsx`

**Roles with Access**:
- `RoleIds.QUALITY_CONTROL_TEAM_MEMBER` (7)
- `RoleIds.SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER` (5)
- `RoleIds.DESIGNER_TEAM_MEMBER` (9)

## Status and Priority Mapping

### Status IDs
- 1 = Pending (Warning color)
- 2 = In Progress (Primary color)
- 3 = Blocked (Danger color)
- 4 = Completed (Success color)

### Priority IDs
- 1 = Low (Default color)
- 2 = Medium (Warning color)
- 3 = High (Danger color)

## API Endpoints Used

### Existing Endpoints
1. `GET /api/MembersTasks` - Get all tasks with pagination and filtering
   - Automatically filters by current user for team members
   - Managers see all department tasks
   - Admins see all tasks

### New Endpoints
1. `PUT /api/MembersTasks/{id}/status` - Update task status
   - Body: `{ "status": "In Progress" }`
   - Returns updated task details

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure SQL Server is running (DESKTOP-88VGRA9)
2. Database PMA should be accessible
3. .NET API server should be running on port 3002 (or configured port)
4. Frontend dev server should be running on port 5173

### Backend Testing

1. **Build the API Server**:
```bash
cd pma-api-server/src/PMA.Api
dotnet build
```

2. **Run the API Server**:
```bash
dotnet run
```

3. **Verify API is Running**:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/api/MembersTasks` (or your configured port)
- Should return tasks based on your current user

### Frontend Testing

1. **Build Frontend** (optional, for checking compilation):
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Run Development Server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Test as Team Member**:
   - Login with a user who has one of these roles:
     - Quality Control Team Member (Role ID: 7)
     - Software Developer (Role ID: 5)
     - Designer Team Member (Role ID: 9)
   - Navigate to the dashboard (home page)
   - Verify TeamMemberDashboard loads

### Component Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] MyAssignedTasks shows user's tasks
- [ ] Task status chips display correct colors
- [ ] Task priority chips display correct colors
- [ ] Click on task navigates to task details
- [ ] TeamQuickActions shows actionable tasks
- [ ] Can click "Start" button on pending tasks
- [ ] Can click "Pause" and "Complete" on in-progress tasks
- [ ] Status update modal opens correctly
- [ ] Status dropdown shows all options
- [ ] Status update succeeds and refreshes data
- [ ] Toast notifications appear on success/error
- [ ] Calendar displays events
- [ ] Language switching works (English/Arabic)
- [ ] RTL layout works in Arabic mode

## Database Requirements

The following tables are used:
- `Tasks` or `RequirementTasks` - Main task table
- `TaskAssignments` - Task assignment to users
- `Users` - User information
- `UserRoles` - User role mappings
- `Roles` - Role definitions
- `Lookups` - Status and priority definitions
- `Projects` - Project information
- `ProjectRequirements` - Requirement information

## Known Limitations

1. **Status Mapping**: Current mapping is hardcoded (1=Pending, 2=In Progress, 3=Blocked, 4=Completed). This should ideally come from the Lookups table.

2. **TypeScript Compilation**: Some type warnings may appear during development but shouldn't affect runtime functionality.

3. **.NET SDK Path**: The .NET SDK must be in PATH to build/run the API server from terminal.

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Login with a team member account and verify all functionality
2. **Adjust Status Mapping**: Update status IDs if your database uses different values
3. **Add More Metrics**: Enhance the dashboard with additional performance metrics
4. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid data)
5. **Performance**: Monitor load times with large datasets
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks not loading
**Solution**: Check if current user has proper role assignments in database

### Issue: Status update fails
**Solution**: Verify API server is running and check browser console for errors

### Issue: Components not rendering
**Solution**: Check browser console for TypeScript/compilation errors

### Issue: Translation keys showing instead of text
**Solution**: Verify LanguageContext.tsx has all required translation keys

## Support

For any issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check API server logs
3. Verify database connection
4. Ensure user has correct role assignments
